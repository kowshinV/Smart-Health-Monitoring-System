# 🩺 Smart Health Monitoring System

This project is a **mini hardware-based system** designed to monitor a person’s vital health parameters such as **body temperature** and **heart rate** using sensors connected to an **Arduino UNO**.  
It continuously measures these parameters and displays them on an LCD screen, helping in basic health tracking without the need for hospital equipment.

## 🔧 Components Used
- Arduino UNO  
- LM35 Temperature Sensor  
- Pulse Sensor (Heart Rate Sensor)  
- 16x2 LCD Display  
- Breadboard and Jumper Wires  
- Power Supply (USB or 9V Battery)

---

## ⚙️ Working Principle
1. The **LM35 sensor** senses body temperature and sends analog data to Arduino.  
2. The **Pulse sensor** measures heartbeat rate through finger pulses.  
3. The Arduino processes both signals and displays the values on the **LCD**.  
4. If values exceed normal limits, the display can alert the user.
