# 🩺 Smart Health Monitoring System

This project is a **mini hardware-based system** designed to monitor a person’s vital health parameters such as **body temperature** and **heart rate** using sensors connected to an **Arduino UNO**.  
It continuously measures these parameters and displays them on an LCD screen, helping in basic health tracking without the need for hospital equipment.

## 🔧 Components Used
- Arduino UNO  
- LM35 Temperature Sensor  
- Pulse Sensor (Heart Rate Sensor)  
- 16x2 LCD Display  
- Breadboard and Jumper Wires  
- Power Supply (USB or 9V Battery)

---

## ⚙️ Working Principle
1. The **LM35 sensor** senses body temperature and sends analog data to Arduino.  
2. The **Pulse sensor** measures heartbeat rate through finger pulses.  
3. The Arduino processes both signals and displays the values on the **LCD**.  
4. If values exceed normal limits, the display can alert the user.

## 🧠 Features
- Real-time temperature and heart rate display  
- Low-cost and portable design  
- Useful for personal or clinical health monitoring  
- Simple to assemble and program

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Connect all components as per the circuit diagram in the PDF.  
2. Open **Arduino IDE** and load the code given in the report.  
3. Select the correct COM port and upload the code to the Arduino UNO.  
4. Power the circuit and observe readings on the LCD.
